# ResponsivePortfolio

This is a website dedicated to my web development future. I have placed small jokes and played around with the subject of my website because I have no portfolio to give. I obviously will update this and know no one can really find this site that easily. I enjoyed committing so many times although it felt impossible at first, I got accustomed to writing more and more commits. I was so blocked with the card-deck I could not get it to be responsive for about two days on and off working on this hw. I tried the colums and rows several times for it but it just did not work. I believe it has something to do the with the fact that the deck has a preset css from bootstrap that wont work well with columns. Finally I was able to research grid-template-columns which worked well to separate my card deck once put into a mobile viewport (The mobile view was the problem the whole time. I dont know if it was required but I couldnt let it go. Website responsiveness was perfect from the beggining of the hw). This part was not enjoyable, and I could have used any other bootstrap but I felt that the cards fit better in my design. Other than this the hw was enjoyable and I learned alot of ways to style a website seeing the power of CSS and Bootstrap when used together. Thanks for reading.
